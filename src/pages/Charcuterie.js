      <P><A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charcuterie">Charcuterie</A> most often consists of a variety of meats and cheeses, often paired with crackers, fruit, nuts, and spreads. An ideal charcuterie board has a good balance of flavors and textures and has foods that contrast and complement each other's taste. It's some really long text. I'm really writing this way later than I should be. Is this what it's like to sell your soul to nwPlus? </P>
